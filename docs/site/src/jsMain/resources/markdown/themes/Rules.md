Rules are the snygg way to describe your stylesheet.
Rules inherit from the parent unless the value is overwritten.

#### Font (``@font `<font-name>` ``)

The `@font` rule is used for defining custom fonts to be used in the stylesheet.


> [!TIP]
> See also [Custom fonts](/themes/fonts#custom-fonts)

#### Root

This is a meta rule. Properties applied to the root rule are inherited (either implicitly or explicitly depending on the property).
If you want to apply something for the whole keyboard UI (like fonts) this is the right place to do.

#### Window

This rule controls the keyboard window.

Note: Mention background image

#### Key

#### Key hint

#### Key popup box

#### Key popup element

#### Key popup extended indicator
